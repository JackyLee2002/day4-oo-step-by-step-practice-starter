O: I learned about Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the concept of reflective programming. Reflective programming allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. Having a basic understanding of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism helped me grasp these advanced concepts more easily. Through practical examples, I practiced identifying common design patterns and applying reflective techniques to enhance code flexibility and reusability.

R: Familiar

I: Understanding Java OOP and reflective programming is crucial for writing robust and adaptable code. Reflective programming, in particular, forced me to think deeply about the dynamic aspects of code and how to leverage them for more flexible solutions. This experience has reinforced the importance of solid OOP principles as a foundation for advanced programming techniques, ultimately leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

D: Moving forward, I plan to integrate OOP techniques more consistently into my development workflow. By using tools like  design pattern libraries, I aim to create more adaptable and reusable code structures. This approach will help maintain high code quality and ensure that the codebase remains flexible and manageable over time, benefiting both myself and my teammates.
