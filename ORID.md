O: I learned about Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the concept of reflective programming. Reflective programming allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. Having a basic understanding of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism helped me grasp these advanced concepts more easily. Through practical examples, I practiced identifying common design patterns and applying OOP techniques to enhance code flexibility and reusability. I also practied Retrospective before the end of the day where we refelcted on the things we did well, could do better, suggestions and actions we could take, for our own, the team and the program as a whole.

R: Familiar

I: Understanding Java OOP and reflective programming is crucial for writing robust and adaptable code. Reflective programming, in particular, forced me to think deeply about the dynamic aspects of code and how to leverage them for more flexible solutions. This experience has reinforced the importance of solid OOP principles as a foundation for advanced programming techniques, ultimately leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. Having practiced Retro before in an application team, I felt really familiar with practicing retro with a team of people.

D: Moving forward, I plan to integrate OOP techniques more consistently into my development workflow. By using tools like  design pattern libraries, I aim to create more adaptable and reusable code structures. This approach will help maintain high code quality and ensure that the codebase remains flexible and manageable over time, benefiting both myself and my teammates. Since our current team does not practice Retro, I will still reflect on these ideas on my own to think about what other teammates and I can do to better improves our efficiency and teamwork.
